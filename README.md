# Repetitive_sequences
Identifies repetitive sequences in genome targetable by Cas12 that are not present in a second genome

The user has to define parameters such as the length of crRNA considering the PAM sequence, PAM sequences that are desired to be detected, and REP (the number of repetitive sequences to be found).
